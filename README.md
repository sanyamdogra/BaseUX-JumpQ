# BaseUX-JumpQ

If you have ever been to a retail store then you must have noticed queues at the billing counter and often these queues become extremely time consuming.

### Not Anymore
With JumpQ smart checkout solution we are providing an easy to use and cross platform mobile application. 

### All you have to do is just scan, pay and go.

Scan the products, pay for them online and breeze out from the store. But as in India shop lifting is quite common so we cannot compromise with the security. So, as the customer pays for his items an invoice will be generated on his mobile phone and that invoice will be cross-checked at the exit.

### So effectively JumpQ  
* Saves your time.
* Increases the profits of the retail stores as the manpower is being reduced.
* The store owner will have proper knowledge of the availability of the items and he will not lose his customers
* Consumers will not be clueless in the aisle as we are providing proper store mapping.

### Technologies Used.
* Flutter, a cross-platform framework based on Dart for both ios and android with the same codebase.
* Firestore Database, so that the consumers will have the their purchase history and retail store owners have a clear idea about the availability of items.
* Firebase ML Kit for barcode scanning.
